# Bounded-buffer

#Producerâ€“Consumer Problem

A bounded-buffer, an array of finite size, is pushed to by a prodcucer and pulled from by a consumer. Producers cannot push to a full buffer and consumers cannot pull from an empty buffer. Producers push integers into the buffer that incement sequentially. Consumers will pull integers from the buffer in first-in-first-out, FIFO, manner.
