# Bounded-buffer


#Producerâ€“Consumer Problem
In the bounded-buffer, an array of finite size is pushed to by a prodcucer and pulled by a consumer. 
Producers cannot push a full buffer and consumers cannot pull from an empty buffer. 
Producers will push integers into the buffer that incement sequentially. 
Consumers will pull integers from the buffer follow first-in-first-out (FIFO) policy.
